# Getting started

If you have the Java 1.6.0 SDK (or above) you can build and run a demo
server with the following commands:

     git clone git://github.com/hudmol/archivesspace.git

     cd archivesspace

     build/run dist

     java -jar archivesspace.jar

This will start the ArchivesSpace application running on:

  http://localhost:8080/

and the backend web service running on:

  http://localhost:8089/

If you'd like to use different ports, you can run:

    java -jar launcher/archivesspace.jar [frontend port] [backend port]

Note: If you have already run the service in demo mode, you may need to remove the existing demo database in order to avoid a 'java.sql.SQLException: Failed to create database' error:

		build/run db:nuke
